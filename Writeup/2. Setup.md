## Prerequisite

Python 2.6 or higher is usually required for installation of Flask. Although Flask and its dependencies work well with Python 3 (Python 3.3 onwards), many Flask extensions do not support it properly. Hence, it is recommended that Flask should be installed on Python 2.7.

## Install virtualenv for development environment

**virtualenv** is a virtual Python environment builder. It helps a user to create multiple Python environments side-by-side. Thereby, it can avoid compatibility issues between the different versions of the libraries.

The following command installs **virtualenv**

```
pip install virtualenv
```

This command needs administrator privileges. Add **sudo** before **pip** on Linux/Mac OS. If you are on Windows, log in as Administrator. On Ubuntu **virtualenv** may be installed using its package manager.
```
Sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```
Once installed, new virtual environment is created in a folder.
```
mkdir newproj
cd newproj
virtualenv venv
```
To activate corresponding environment, on **Linux/OS X**, use the following −
```
venv/bin/activate
```
On **Windows**, following can be used
```
venv\scripts\activate
```
We are now ready to install Flask in this environment.
```
pip install Flask flask-sqlalchemy
```
The above command can be run directly, without virtual environment for system-wide installation.

Now create a file `app.py` outside venv folder and add the code.

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
	return "Hello World"
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(debug=True)
```

Now run the app using 
```
python app.py
```

It will be served by default on localhost:5000/
