Now we know about serving html and template inheritance and its time to include CSS as well.

Create `static/css/main.css` and add the following code.
```
body{
	background-color: aqua;
	margin: 0px;
}
```

Now open `app.py` and add this line

```
from flask import url\_for
```

Now let's link css to our base template open `base.html` and add
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url\_for('static', filename='css/main.css')}}"\>
```
