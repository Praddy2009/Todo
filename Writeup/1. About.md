## What is Flask?

Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is developed by **Armin Ronacher**, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

## WSGI

Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.

## Werkzeug

It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.

## Jinja2

Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.
